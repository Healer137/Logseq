### 1) INSTRUCTIONS w/ WRITING PROMPTS:
#### Question 1:: #[[Fleeting Notes]] Place these answers underneath as children blocks
##### What resonates with you?

##### What are the associations that come to mind?

##### What else does that remind you of?

##### Can you pull out an abstraction from that?

#### Summarize Question 1:: Place this on the block as your `#Fleeting Notes` → next to it
##### How would you summarize what you wrote, so you can get a thumbnail understanding in one quick glance, of the larger high resolution thoughts?

#### Question 2:: #[[Literature Notes]]
##### Being informed by what you abstracted, what is the author saying?

##### How can you write that in your own words, without summarizing, to prove to yourself that you’ve understood what they are saying?

##### Were you able to abstract what the author is saying into your own words?

#### Summarize Question 2:: Place this on the block as your `#Literature Notes` → next to it
##### How would you summarize what you wrote, so you can get a thumbnail understanding in one quick glance, of the larger high resolution thoughts?

#### Question 3:: #Zettels
##### Being informed by the fleeting notes, the literature notes, and the source to the right, what is the declarative statement that you can say about what you’ve synthesized?

##### How can you word this statement in a way that gives you the most clarity in what you mean?

### 2) EXAMPLE:
#### #Zettels ^^[[Answer to Question 3 will go here, and after it has been stated clearly--use the double brackets to enclose it into a page]]^^
##### #[[Reference Notes]] ^^((block reference the SOURCE))^^

##### #[[Literature Notes]] ^^Summarization of Question 2^^
###### Answers to Question 2 will go here and because we are not limited to the physical index-cards we can elaborate further on ^^**__what we understand the author stating__**^^

###### Which allows for deeper levels of analysis and assists in "bringing up" what we have synthesized following this (bottom-up structure)

##### #[[Fleeting Notes]] ^^Summarization of Question 1^^
###### Answers to Question 1 will go here and because we are note limited to the physical index-cards we can elaborate further on ^^**__what resonates for us, outside of what the author is stating__**^^

###### Which allows for deeper levels of analysis and assists in "bringing up" what we have synthesized following this (bottom-up structure)
####### We can open-and-close this wall of text to keep the entire permanent note cleanly displayed

###### Through nesting we can elaborate much further with this step than we could if we used the analog slip box 
####### And the Summarization of these notes, as a thumbnail, can be placed at the block-level above, as shown
